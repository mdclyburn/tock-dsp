    /// running. NOTE in this case the chip must have fixed the underlying
    /// reason for fault otherwise it will re-occur.

    /// This can not be used for apps to circumvent Tock's protections. If

    ///      types of faults. For example if an app triggers a memory parity
    ///      error the kernel can handle the error and allow the app to
    ///      continue (or not).
    ///    - Allow an app to execute from external QSPI.
