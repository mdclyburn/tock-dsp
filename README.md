**This is an incompatible fork of the Tock OS project.**
The repository for the real Tock is [here](https://github.com/tock/tock).

Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually
distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms.
Tock's design
centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and
from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components
of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in
Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety,
type safety and strict aliasing. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the
scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers
as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory
protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel.
